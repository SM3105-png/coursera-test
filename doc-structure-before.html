There are a total of 19 different species of penguins. These penguins live in Antarctica, New Zealand, Australia, the Gal√†pagos Islands, Chile, Argentina, South Africa and Namibia. This just goes to show that all penguins do not require ice and snow to survive. African Penguins are able to survive the scorching summers over there! Penguins are amazing!
